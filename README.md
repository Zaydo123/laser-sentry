# laser-sentry

## Hello, this is a project I completed as an early teenager and would like to share the progress I was able to make while learning about computer vision. Please note while analyzing this code and Readme.md that this was written by a slightly younger me, thank you! 

Inspired by Michael Reeves' blinding machine. (Work in progress) 
Code based on https://towardsdatascience.com/automatic-vision-object-tracking-347af1cc8a3b
## Requirements
Raspberry Pi 3/4, 2 MG996R servo motors, webcam (C920), breadboard, laser diode, 3d printer, and a can of beans.
```pip install opencv-python```
```pip install numpy```

## Current State

I am currently unable to continue this project due to rising costs of hardware due to supply chain shortages. 
Code Functional (although far from complete), hardware in need of redesign.

## To Do
[] Create final build instructions
[] Smooth out servo motion
[] Increase operating FPS
