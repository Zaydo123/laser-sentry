# laser-sentry
Inspired by Michael Reeves' blinding machine. (Work in progress) 
Code based on https://towardsdatascience.com/automatic-vision-object-tracking-347af1cc8a3b
## Requirements
Raspberry Pi 3/4, 2 Servo motors, webcam (C920), breadboard, laser diode, 3d printer, and a can of beans.
```pip install opencv-python```
```pip install numpy```

## Current State
Currently, this project isn't finished. Right now I only have the ability to move the X-axis, as I have only now designed the y axis 3d print. Print the stl file attached, and you should be caught up to me.

## To Do
Ill be uploading a GPIO pinout diagram soon. 
Video instructions coming... eventually.
